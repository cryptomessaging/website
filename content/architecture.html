<h1>Architecture</h1>

<p class="intro">
	Cryptomessaging is a decentralized instant messaging system.
</p>

<p>
	The cryptomessaging architecture is driven by three design tenets:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Cryptographically Derived Identity</strong> such as accounts on Bitcoin, allows the creation of one or more chat ids for each person and enables operation without a userid.  This system lets people create identities without the need for a central user account authority.</li>

		<li><strong>Decentralized Message Forwarding</strong> where there is no central server managing all accounts. Instead, thousands of servers managed by different people or organizations work together to deliver messages.</li>

		<li><strong>Open Source</strong> where software can be reviewed by peers to quickly discover security issues and identify bad actors.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Network Architecture</h2>

<p>
	The following diagram is a simplified view of the different Cryptomessaging services and clients and how they interact:

<p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>iOS and Android apps</strong> provide the messaging interface to the person.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Keyrings</strong> store people's public and private keys.  These keyrings may exist on the client device, may be backed up by cloud offerings, or may be stored securely in remote servers.</li>

		<li><strong>Messages</strong> are stored in the apps.</li>		

		<li>Many <strong>Message Reflectors</strong> accept messages from Cryptomessaging apps and forward them to the appropriate clients.  For group chats, a single message may to sent to several different reflectors.</li>

		<li><strong>Apple Push Service</strong> is the Apple Push Notification service.</li>

		<li><strong>Android Push Service</strong> is the Google Firebase Cloud Messaging service.</li>
	</ul>
