<h1>Privacy Isn't A Luxury</h1>

<h2>Privacy is an essential ingredient of all free societies</h2>

<p>Cryptomessaging.org is creating open source software to allow free people to communicate privately.  Services such as <a href="https://signal.org" target="signal">Signal</a> already provide end-to-end encryption, but the centralized servers provide a chokepoint and the requirement that you use your phone number exposes too much personal information.</p>

<p>Cryptomessaging uses decentralized identity and messaging reflectors to create a truly private and durable infrastructure to exchange messages.</p>
